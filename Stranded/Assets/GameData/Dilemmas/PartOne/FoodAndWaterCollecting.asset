  successText: As if blessed with a miracle, the survivors managed to collect fruits
    and meat and distill water of high quality. In front of them, there are all the
    ingredients for a tasty and nutritious meal. Life on a deserted island is not
    so bad!
  partialSuccessText: Not all food and water collecting endeavours were a success,
    but there seems to be enough food to feed everyone. The survivors are relieved
    to have a meal for the day.
  failureText: "The search for food was a disaster. Almost everyone returned empty-handed.
    Luckily, one of the other survivors found a crate of dry, tasteless crackers
    in the lifeboat. The survivors won\u2019t have to go hungry but no one will be
    enjoying this meal."

  successText: 'As if blessed with a miracle, the survivors managed to collect fruits
    and meat and distill water of high quality.

    In front of them, there are
    all the ingredients for a tasty and nutritious meal.

    Life on a deserted
    island is not so bad!'
  partialSuccessText: 'Not all food and water collecting endeavours were a success,

    but
    there seems to be enough food to feed everyone.

    The survivors are relieved
    to have a meal for the day.'
  failureText: "The search for food was a disaster. Almost everyone returned empty-handed.\nLuckily,
    one of the other survivors found a crate of dry, tasteless crackers in the lifeboat.\nThe
    survivors won\u2019t have to go hungry but no one will be enjoying this meal."

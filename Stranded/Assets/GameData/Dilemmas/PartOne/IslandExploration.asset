  successText: The expedition went quicker than expected. The team worked together
    well and, before they knew it, they mapped out the whole island. They encountered
    some wild animals along the way but managed to avoid them.
  partialSuccessText: The expedition turned out to be quite the adventure. The team
    got lost for an hour in the deep forest and at some point they stood eye to eye
    with a gorilla-bear. But, in the end, they arrived safely home with a decent
    map.
  failureText: "The moment the team set foot in the forest, they were practically
    immediately lost. After hearing a weird sound coming from the bushes, they decided
    to just take a run for it. They managed to reach the beach and walk back home
    along the island\u2019s perimeter."

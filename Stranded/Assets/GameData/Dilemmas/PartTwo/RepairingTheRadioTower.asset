  title: Repairing the radio tower
  description: One of the survivors had seen that on the top of the mountain at the
    centre of the island there is an old radio tower. They want to repair it to send
    out a distress message. The tower is however looking rusty and parts of the ladder
    are broken.

  successText: "Everyone did their job well and the operation ran smoothly. The survivors
    managed to quickly fix the radio tower and send out an S.O.S. signal. It is still
    unclear however whether someone received it\u2026"
  partialSuccessText: "Not everything went according to plan and it took several
    tries to fix the radio emitter but in the end the survivors managed to get it
    done and send out an S.O.S. signal. It is still unclear however whether someone
    received it\u2026"
  failureText: The survivors tried their best to fix the radio tower but it took
    too much time to get it done and, before long, lightning struck the tower and
    permanently damaged the radio system.

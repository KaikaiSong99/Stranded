  title: Building a raft
  description: A raft is the only way to escape the island on their own. The survivors
    decide to make an attempt at building a raft that is reliable and functional
    enough to carry them to the mainland safely.
  playTime: 40
  isCounted: 1
  minJobSuccess: 3
  successText: The raft-making worked perfectly. The raft was big enough for everyone
    to fit on and could float on the water without any leakage. This raft was definitely
    sea-worthy.
  partialSuccessText: The survivors ran into unexpected problems when they were making
    the raft but they managed to finalize the work somehow. The raft worked well
    enough and could hold their weight.
  failureText: "The survivors tried hard to build the raft but the process was very
    hard and time-consuming. When they finally got it in the water, they found out
    that the raft simply didn\u2019t float. It sank into the sea."

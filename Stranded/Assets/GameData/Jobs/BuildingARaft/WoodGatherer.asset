  description: Someone has to chop trees to get large logs for the raft.

  idealAssignedDialogue: It's a shame that we have to use all logs for the raft.
    Some of them were real nice to do squats with.
  idealSuggestDialogue: Don't underestimate those logs! They are heavy! I would start
    with something smaller if I were you, rookie!

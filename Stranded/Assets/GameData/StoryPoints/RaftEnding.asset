  storyText:
  - After successfully constructing a raft, the survivors decided to wait for the
    storm to settle. Eventually, the rains stopped and they ventured out into the
    sea.
  - The journey was still a bit scary but they managed to traverse the waters and
    reach a larger, inhabited island. The survivors were welcomed on land by the
    local authorities and, with that, they were saved!

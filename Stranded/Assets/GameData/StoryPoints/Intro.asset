  storyText:
  - "In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a cruise ship called \u201Cthe Amadea\u201D
    is making its journey to South America. While the tourists on board have been
    enjoying a calm trip so far, none of them could have anticipated that their holiday
    is about to end in disaster\u2026"
  - A thunderous crashing sound echoes through the corridors. The ship vibrates violently.
    The captain explains the situation on the intercom. The bow of the vessel has
    been penetrated by a sharp reef.
  - The passengers hurry to the top deck to board the numerous lifeboats to escape
    from the sinking cruise ship. One by one, the full lifeboats drop into the ocean.
  - Then, fate strikes again. A storm breaks. Tall waves rise up from the sea. One
    unfortunate lifeboat gets lifted up by a wave and separated from the pack. The
    current carries it to the shore of an island. The lifeboat crashes into the pebbles.
  - The passengers of the broken lifeboat step out onto this new land. This small
    group of unfortunate survivors find themselves alone on a deserted island, stranded.

  storyText:
  - The survivors were confident in their ability to escape and ventured head-first
    into the storm with their raft.
  - Their suspicions turned out to be correct. Halfway they encountered a rescue
    ship. It had been alerted by their distress signal. They were taken aboard and,
    with that, the survivors were saved!

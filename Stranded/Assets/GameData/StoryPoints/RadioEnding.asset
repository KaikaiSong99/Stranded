  storyText:
  - The survivors lost hope for a moment, having seen their raft being swallowed
    by the storm. But then one of them noticed a faint flashing light at the horizon.
  - The light slowly grew more pronounced and it turned out to belong to a rescue
    ship alerted by their distress signal. It headed straight for the island. After
    it arrived, the survivors were taken aboard and, with that, they were saved!

  storyText:
  - While the stranded group is certainly not lacking in talent, for now they have
    only experienced adversities. Luckily, eventually, the rains stop and the winds
    calm down. They have made it through.
  - "However, with the radio tower broken and with the raft laying on the seafloor,
    the survivors better get used to each other\u2019s company. It looks like they
    will be staying on the island for some time."
